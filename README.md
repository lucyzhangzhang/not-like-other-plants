# Phosphate starvation-induced trends

This section compares transcriptomes from plants exposed to phosphate deficiency, the trends in remodeling and differential expression of gene groups.

This experiment looks at the roots alone, apparently have >9000 2.0 fold + transcripts when exposed to low phosphate.

Plants were either exposed to 100 uM (Pi sufficient) or 1 uM (Pi deficient) KH2PO4

Shit it's a hexaploid, I'm not doing this.
